This might be the last devlog posted on this website, because we're happy to announce: The major website refractor plan is releasing Beta in between May 1 - May 5!

We Call it "The Edge Project", at the time, a banner will indicate for you the beta link

Not to mention

What we did are:

- Moved every devlog here to another data type, made custom markdown standard we call "Prefixed Markdown" "PMD"
- Revamped everything on the main page, including the devlog page
- added page header and footer

What we are doing are:

- Add searching feature on the website
- Migrate code clicker & splatools
- Rework some features not good in the alpha development stage

Now, i'ma work on some videos and my exams, and hopefully, we'll get it released on May!

Thank you!
