Q: Where have you gone? Why are you not updating?

A: I'm working on a massive update on Code Clicker and it shouldn't be released until 30+ upgrades is all done, stay tuned!

Now were talking about the Splatool just released here, I made it just because why not? now you can really only do calculation on Anarchy Battles (Series)'s points result and i don't even know why i did it, but just enjoy lol!

P.S. The rounds you lost includes in the medals calculation and do not have a negative impact on points results

P.S.S. here's a leak on the Code Clicker Update
