Hi! Likia here, so this is the website im recently working on, I'm not going to really post a lot of things here because like the project structure is not complete, and I may migrate this .html page to loading a Markdown file. But yeah still there's going to some Html minigames (Its on the homepage) and more stuff posting here. Chinese and other language localisation to this website is coming soon, stay tuned! If you like this website, consider saving it to your Bookmark bar to stay tuned to our(my?) latest updates, enjoy!
