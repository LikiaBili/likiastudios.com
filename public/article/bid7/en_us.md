Good Morning, Everyone! Now we're still at the humble beginnings stage of this new "Edge Project". Anything and everything is subject to change. Let's just call it a day a relax a little bit.

When we fixed every obvious bug and moved everything to our new home, the old website will be archived. Glad didn't put that much effort to that old thingy huh?

Anyway, my summer holiday started and im turning grade 9 in september, and my goal over this holiday is to primerelly focus on video content creation on both bilibili and youtube.

So... Thats it! ill keep more things to the next devlog, see you in a bit!
